# 8-bit-CAM-Content-Addressable-Memory

8 bit CAM using 1 bit CAM simulated in Dsch2

The project focuses on the design and performance analysis of a simple 8-bit CAM circuit. The circuit is simulated using DSCH2 software. The 8-bit CAM can be implemented with either NAND gates or transmission gates (CMOS).

The main aim of the project is to become familiar with memories and the DSCH2 software.

The DSCH program is a logic editor and simulator used to validate the architecture of logic circuits before beginning microelectronics design.The Dsch can generate the Verilog code file.

#Dsch2

First I have generated a 1 bit CAM using NAND gates.

Next, using the above instantiation, 8 bit CAM can be generated.

The simulation output of the circuit.(Glowing of LEDS indicate the BL and SL are same and outut Matched Line is high)
